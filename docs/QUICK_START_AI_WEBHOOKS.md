## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **"No AI response received"**

**Check:**
1. `.env` has `AI_RESPONSES_ENABLED=true`
2. Server is running (terminal shows logs)
3. Localtunnel is running
4. Webhook URL is correct in Twilio

**Test webhook:**
```powershell
# In a new terminal
curl https://your-url.loca.lt/api/webhooks/sms
```

Should return: `Cannot POST /api/webhooks/sms` (that's OK - means URL is accessible)

---

### **"Webhook not triggered"**

**Check:**
1. Localtunnel shows your URL
2. Twilio webhook URL matches exactly
3. URL includes `/api/webhooks/sms` at the end
4. Server logs show "Received SMS webhook"

**View Twilio logs:**
https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/sms

---

### **"Server error"**

**Check:**
1. MongoDB is running
2. `.env` file is in `server/` directory
3. Server restarted after creating `.env`

**Test MongoDB:**
```powershell
# Should connect without error
mongo mongodb://localhost:27017/multi_channel_chat
```
