## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **1. Number Must Be Verified**

If the number isn't verified, you'll see this error:

```

[error] ⚠️  Make sure +1234567890 is verified as a Caller ID
[error] ⚠️  Verification URL: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/verified
```

**Solution:** Verify the number in Twilio Console

### **2. Trial Account Limitations**

If you're on a **Twilio trial account**:
- ✅ Can send to/from verified numbers only
- ✅ Can send to/from Twilio numbers you purchased
- ❌ Cannot send to unverified numbers
- Messages will have "Sent from your Twilio trial account" prefix

**Solution:** Upgrade to paid account to remove restrictions

### **3. Number Format**

Always use **E.164 format**:
- ✅ Correct: `+1234567890`
- ❌ Wrong: `234567890`
- ❌ Wrong: `(234) 567-890`
- ❌ Wrong: `+1 234 567 890`
